    # you if the request was successful. Print out "good to go!" if
    # r.status_code is 200.


    # FILL IN THE BLANK! Output the HTML of the page you just retrieved.
    # Once you have that working, comment this out â€” you won't need it 
    # for the next step.


    # FILL IN THE BLANK! Create a BeautifulSoup object named soup. 
    # Find and print the first h1 header on the page.

    # heading.


    # FILL IN THE BLANK! Find all the links on the page.
